## How to Dissapear Online?
### This is a wiki format tutorial on the why, what, and hows of doing a digital security audit and making yourself dissapear online. I will use OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques to audit a email account and find as much data on it as I can in attempts to request deletion and wipeing of that public data.

### This topic matters to me because I have always been interested in privacy, and security ever since I have gotten into the cybersecurity field. I also have recent need of finding a way to wipe an old sudoname I used online and will use this as an oppurtunity to really dive deep into issues of privacy and data collection as it pertains to social medias.
